\section{Mathematical Model} 

The system of stations linked by bike paths is considered as a graph, where the stations are represented by nodes.  The bike paths linking them are considered as weighted edges, with the weight corresponding to their length or cost, which are directly proportional.  

It is stipulated that all bus stops must be served by the system of bike paths, and so the graph must be spanning.  Likewise, it is not necessary that every two stations have a distinct, unique bike lane serving them, and so it is not necessary that the graph be a network.  So the ideal graph should include a minimum spanning tree as a subgraph and potentially
